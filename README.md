# Appointment-Scheduling-Algoirthm
The algorithm is created from the backend perspective.

Case Scenario :
A Manager is avilable for **1hrs 30mins (duration)**  which should be divided into **15 min slots** ( possible 6 slots in each duration ) which can be booked by customers.

Problem:
Make the algo for scheduler that manager use so that he can proivde the **duration** ( as input ) and every duration should maintain a 30 min **gap** ( so that manager can relax in btw). 

To achieve generalisation, the following constraints are variable:
  1. Overall Duration
  2. Slots duration
  3. Gap
